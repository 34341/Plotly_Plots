# Plotly_Plots
The Jupyter Notebook has all my work on trying to visualze point cloud data taken with an Ouster OS1 device. 

The most useful section and the one I am currently working on is the PANDAS section where I was able to create a dataframe of the data and plot it using the Plotly package. I still need to fix the scale of the plots and test the accuracy of the range for the points for each frame.
